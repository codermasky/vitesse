Linedata Vitesse AI: Dynamic Discovery and Knowledge Harvesting Framework
This document outlines the refined architecture for Linedata Vitesse AI, integrating a proactive Knowledge Harvesting Agent to enable instantaneous and robust discovery, replacing brittle pre-built connectors with true on-the-fly agentic creation.

Interactive Discovery Flow
The refined flow transitions from simple search to an intelligent, interactive experience:

1. User Intent: A user initiates a request (e.g., "Salesforce integration") within the AgentStack interface.

2. Instantaneous Discovery: The Discovery Agent immediately queries a continuously updated, persistent Knowledge Base (built by the Knowledge Harvesting Agent).

3. Validated Options: The Discovery Agent presents a curated and validated list of options sourced from the Knowledge Base, ensuring reliability and relevance.

4. Seamless Transition: Upon user selection, the workflow seamlessly transitions to the Ingestor phase, which automatically generates necessary tools through the Mapper, Guardian, and Deployer steps, based on the structured data.

Proactive Knowledge Harvesting Agent
A crucial component for Vitesse speed and robustness is the Proactive Knowledge Harvesting Agent. This agent operates continuously in the background to ensure the Discovery Agent has immediate access to comprehensive and current information, eliminating user wait times.

• Continuous Scanning: The agent actively scans, gathers, and analyzes documentation from diverse sources.

• Knowledge Base Maintenance: It builds and maintains a persistent, versioned, and structured Linedata Knowledge Base.

• Contextualization: Information is structured and contextualized to be readily consumable for instantaneous validation and blueprinting by the Discovery Agent.

Reliable Sources for Knowledge Harvesting
The Knowledge Harvesting Agent can be pointed to the following reliable, enterprise-wide accepted sources to build the comprehensive library:

• Internal Documentation: Existing proprietary systems, such as MCP Context 7, for specific context and established internal standards.

• API Directories: Enterprise-grade platforms and marketplaces that offer extensive and structured API specifications (e.g., Postman's API Network, RapidAPI).

• Open-Source Frameworks: Analysis of established open-source integration libraries to understand prevalent patterns and best practices for robust, on-the-fly blueprinting.

Self-Healing and Adaptation
To enhance autonomy and ensure continuous reliability, a Self-Healing and Adaptation Agent should be integrated throughout the framework.

• Comprehensive Integration: Operates concurrently with both Discovery (proactive conflict resolution and knowledge gap filling) and Deployment (real-time error recovery).

• Dynamic Problem-Solving: Addresses integration roadblocks and dynamically adapts the system, complementing the Guardian agent's primary focus on security and compliance during deployment.

Continuous Learning and Explainability
The concept of a Feedback Loop and Continuous Learning mechanism is noted as a vital extension to the existing AgentStack platform's monitoring and performance capabilities.

• Monitoring and Evaluation Agent: Introduction of a dedicated agent for constant observation of the workflow, capturing user feedback during runtime, and gathering performance data.

• System Refinement: This data fuels continuous improvement, allowing the Linedata Vitesse AI system to automatically adapt and refine dynamic integration strategies over time.

• Transparency: Crucial focus on enhancing Explainability and transparency within the agentic workflow, particularly during dynamic Self-Healing processes.
